# LuaMani
**LuaMani** is a list of games for SteamTools and GreenLuma(modified) with ~2000 games. Almost every game is marked with its app ID. It is used for the [LuaMani](luamani.vercel.app) website and is available for everybody to use and modify.

# Tools:

  1. **LuaMani** injection tool (comming soon)

  2. **SteamTools**The most popular tool to inject and compile these game files into **Steam** is [SteamTools](steamtools.net), there are concerns about it being unsafe so use it carefully or look into alternative   injection tools.
     
  3. **GreenLuma**

Some people online have claimed that they were able to modify GreenLuma to inject these files into Steam and basically do the same as SteamTools, but with no concern. (Code might be hard to find or make)

# How to contribute

If you see a game that is not available in **LuaMani** and you have the files consider contributing by making a pull request. If you found a huge collection of games not found in **LuaMani** add an issue with the solution. Another way to contribute is just by starring the database and recommending it to people trying to easily find Lua and Manifest files.
