# LuaMani
**LuaMani** is a community-driven database of manifest and Lua files for over 1900 Steam games. This repository provides the files used by the LuaMani website to help users easily find and download Lua and Manifest files for Steam games.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This database contains **1992 compressed files** split across `folder1` and `folder2` due to GitHub's file limits. While we strive for accuracy, please be aware:
* Some games may have duplicate entries.
* Some files may be missing or marked with an incorrect Steam AppID.
* This is a community-maintained project. Contributions and corrections are highly welcome!

## Injector Tools

To use these files, you need a tool to inject them into your Steam client. Here are some of the known methods:

1.  **SteamTools**
    * **Website:** `steamtools.net`
    * This is a popular and widely-used tool for injecting and compiling these types of files.
    * **Note:** Some users in the community have raised security concerns. Please do your own research before using it.

2.  **GreenLuma**
    * Some advanced users have reported success in modifying GreenLuma to inject these files, which may bypass the concerns associated with other tools.
    * This is an unofficial method and may require significant technical knowledge to implement.

3. **Other Custom or Unknown Alternatives**

*Make sure you find and read documentation of the tools you use carefully. This readme simplifies everything*

## How to Use

The general process (for SteamTools) is simple, though it varies slightly depending on your chosen tool:

1.  Download the `.zip` file for the game you want from the **LuaMani** website or this repository.
2.  Unzip the .zip file you downloaded.
3.  Use an injector tool (like SteamTools) to apply the files. This usually involves a simple drag-and-drop.
4.  Restart your Steam client to see the changes.

*We recommend searching for a specific guide or tutorial for the injection software you decide to use.*
